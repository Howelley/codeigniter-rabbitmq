### Run RabbitMQ server
The RabbitMQ server scripts are installed into /usr/local/sbin. This is not automatically added to your path, so you may wish to add PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/sbin to your .bash_profile or .profile. The server can then be started with rabbitmq-server. All scripts run under your own user account. Sudo is not required.
